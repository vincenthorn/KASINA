[![Go Direct® Respiration Belt | Vernier Canada](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ldMzsVMwSihi3zul8phfIgHaEK\&pid=Api)](https://www.verniercanada.ca/product/sensors/go-direct-sensors/go-direct-respiration-belt/)

Yes, Vernier provides documentation for the Go Direct Respiration Belt, which can assist in understanding the data structure and accessing the necessary information for your project.

### 📄 Key Information from Vernier's Documentation

* **Measurement Channels**: The Go Direct Respiration Belt offers four measurement channels:

  * **Force**: Measures respiration effort (force exerted by the chest during breathing).
  * **Respiration Rate**: Calculates breaths per minute.
  * **Steps** and **Step Rate**: Additional features not central to your current application.

* **Data Transmission**: The device transmits data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and USB. The data includes real-time measurements from the active channels.

* **Data Format**: While the exact data packet structure isn't publicly detailed, Vernier's [Graphical Analysis™ 4 app](https://www.vernier.com/ga4) utilizes this data to display real-time graphs, indicating that the data can be parsed to extract meaningful values.

### 🔧 Recommendations for Your Project

1. **Utilize Vernier's Python Library**: Vernier provides a Python module called `godirect` that facilitates communication with Go Direct sensors over BLE or USB. This library can help in accessing and interpreting the data from the respiration belt.

   * **Installation**:

     ```bash
     pip install godirect
     ```

   * **Usage**:

     ```python
     from godirect import GoDirect
     gdx = GoDirect()
     gdx.select_sensors([1])  # Select the desired sensor channel
     gdx.start()
     data = gdx.read()
     ```

   * **Documentation**: [Vernier's GitHub Repository](https://vernierst.github.io/godirect-examples/python/)

2. **Data Parsing**: Since you're receiving data packets with structures like `{ rawReading: 0, timestamp: 1747773946045, timeSinceUpdate: ..., currentData: null }`, it's essential to:

   * **Inspect Raw Data**: Log the raw data to understand its structure.
   * **Determine Data Types**: Identify if the data is in `Uint16`, `Float32`, or another format.
   * **Normalize Values**: Convert the raw readings into meaningful units (e.g., Newtons for force).

3. **Web Bluetooth API**: If you're developing a web application, you can use the Web Bluetooth API to connect to the respiration belt. Ensure that:

   * **Device Filters**: Use filters to identify the Go Direct Respiration Belt.
   * **Service and Characteristic UUIDs**: Obtain the correct UUIDs for the services and characteristics you need to access. These may require using tools like nRF Connect to discover.

4. **Contact Vernier Support**: For detailed information on the data packet structure and BLE characteristics, consider reaching out to Vernier's technical support or consulting their [manuals and documentation](https://www.vernier.com/manuals/gdx-rb/).

By following these steps and utilizing Vernier's resources, you should be able to effectively access and interpret the data from the Go Direct Respiration Belt for your Breath Kasina project.
