That leaves us with 3 top remaining suspects:
1. Application-level Timeout Logic or Unintentional Trigger (MOST LIKELY)
Some piece of your app is still triggering a redirect, unmount, or reset right around the 4:45 mark—even if you can’t find it yet.

Even subtle things like:

Token/session refresh logic

Silent redirect to homepage on expired session

Timer set early in the session

Conditional setState or navigate() that hits after ~5 mins

✅ Next Diagnostic Step:
Log all app navigation events and component unmounts with timestamps:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`[MOUNT] VisualKasinaOrb at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  return () => {
    console.log(`[UNMOUNT] VisualKasinaOrb at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  };
}, []);
And log all navigation actions:

tsx
Copy
Edit
history.listen((location, action) => {
  console.log(`[NAVIGATION] ${action} to ${location.pathname} at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
});
This will catch the exact trigger the moment the crash happens. You’ll know what, where, and why.

2. Authentication or Session Token Expiry
If your app uses:

Firebase

Supabase

JWTs

OAuth session tokens

…it’s possible that production is configured to expire a session at 5 minutes due to missing refresh token handling or secure HTTP-only cookies that don’t refresh properly.

✅ Diagnostic Test:
Check the network tab for a silent 401 or 403 just before the crash.

Also, log:

tsx
Copy
Edit
console.log('Auth token expires at:', token?.exp);
And watch what happens at minute 5.

3. Deployment Environment-Specific Policy
If you're still hosting the production build on Replit's web container, and all of this still happens only on https://kasina.app or the production alias…

…it’s possible that Replit is enforcing a hard platform-level timeout or memory cap for browser-connected apps that run continuously with WebGL or animation loops.

This may not manifest as a “crash” in the usual sense, but as an internal container reload, idle timeout, or IFrame memory flush.

✅ Diagnostic Test:
Deploy the same production build on another platform (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages).

Run for 10+ minutes.

If the crash does not occur there, the root cause is almost certainly Replit platform constraints.
