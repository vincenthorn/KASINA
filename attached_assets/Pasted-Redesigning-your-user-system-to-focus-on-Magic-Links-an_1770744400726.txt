Redesigning your user system to focus on Magic Links and 6-digit codes is a great way to improve security and user experience by removing the need for passwords.

Here is a breakdown of how you can structure this system:
1. Account Setup & Sign-Up
When a new user enters their email:
• Verification: Instead of asking for a password, send a Magic Link or a 6-digit code to their email immediately.
• Profile Creation: Once they click the link or enter the code, the account is marked as “verified.” You can then prompt them for a username or display name to complete the setup.
2. Logging In (Passwordless Flow)
You can offer two seamless ways to log in:
• Magic Link (Best for Desktop): The user clicks a button in their email and is automatically redirected and logged in.
• 6-Digit Code (Best for Mobile): The user stays on your app and types in the code they received. This is often easier than switching apps to click a link on a smartphone.
3. Technical Implementation
To manage these features, you will need:
• Token Generation: A secure, short-lived token (e.g., 5–10 minutes) stored in your database or a cache like Redis.
• Email Provider: A service like Postmark, SendGrid, or Resend to deliver the links and codes reliably.
• Authentication Library: If you are using web frameworks, tools like Supabase, Clerk, or Auth0 have “Passwordless” modes built-in that handle both Magic Links and OTP (One-Time Password) codes out of the box.
4. Managing Friends
Since you want users to manage their own accounts while keeping a social aspect:
• Privacy Settings: Let users choose if they are “searchable” by email or username.
• Friend Requests: When a user wants to add a friend, send a notification to the target user. The relationship is only “active” once the other person accepts, ensuring users retain control over their own friend list.

Comparison of Methods



Method
User Effort
Security
Best Use Case




Magic Link
Very Low (1 click)
High
Desktop browsers


6-Digit Code
Low (Typing)
High
Mobile apps / Cross-device login



Recommendation: Most modern apps implement both. Let the user enter their email, then send one email containing both a clickable link and the 6-digit code. The user can then choose whichever is more convenient at that moment.
